# Web Resume (on Hyptiotes.js)

This is the source for my online resume made with an experimental ultralight-weight framework (hyptiotes.js)

Note: I'm keeping a copy of hyptiotes locally but will publish when it's more stable.

### Commands
`npm run dev`: Serves web page as live reloading webpack dev server

`npm run publish`: Packs files and pushes to `gh-pages` branch which serves github page: https://makakoa.github.io/resume/
